# GitHubRepositoryClassifier

## subject of the [informatiCup 2016/2017](https://github.com/InformatiCup/InformatiCup2017/)

This Programm will take an URL of a github repository as the input and will try to assign it to one of seven Categories.

The Categories are:
* **DEV** - a repository primarily used for development of a tool, component, application, app or API
* **HW** - a repository primarily used for homework, assignments and other course-related work and code.
* **EDU** - a repository primarily used to host tutorials, lectures, educational information and code related to teaching
* **DOCS** - a repository primarily used for tracking and storage of non-educational documents
* **WEB** - a repository primarily used to host static personal webpages or blogs
* **DATA** - a repository primarily used to store data sets
* **OTHER** - this category is used only if there is no strong correlation to any other repository category


## Installation

[Download the zip file from here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/p6dvmt5xtdazjaz/GitHubClassifier.zip?dl=0), unzip it wherever you want and execute one of the batch files.  

The rc_gui will open up a GUI for you to use comfortably.  

The rc_cli will provide a way for you to use the classifier with the commandline, including a console-menu.  
This even accepts arguments directly so you can automate the process if you wish to do so.
You can even give it a .txt file with many repositories to classify and it will create a new file with the results for you.
