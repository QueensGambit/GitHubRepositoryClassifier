## Introduction
### subject of the [informatiCup 2016/2017](https://github.com/InformatiCup/InformatiCup2017/)

This program will take an URL of a GitHub repository as the input and will try to assign it to one of seven categories.

The categories are:
* **DEV** - a repository primarily used for development of a tool, component, application, app or API
* **HW** - a repository primarily used for homework, assignments and other course-related work and code.
* **EDU** - a repository primarily used to host tutorials, lectures, educational information and code related to teaching
* **DOCS** - a repository primarily used for tracking and storage of non-educational documents
* **WEB** - a repository primarily used to host static personal webpages or blogs
* **DATA** - a repository primarily used to store data sets
* **OTHER** - this category is used only if there is no strong correlation to any other repository category


## Installation

### Executable

We built an executable for **Windows-x64** systems which should work on most systems.
No Python installation and no external library, except Open-GL 2.0 (which should be installed by default on your system) is required to run the executable.


[You can download the zip-file from here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/p6dvmt5xtdazjaz/GitHubClassifier.zip?dl=0), unzip it to an arbitrary location and execute one of the batch files.

You can launch the GUI via **rc_gui.bat** and the CLI via **rc_cli.bat**.

*If you have trouble executing the GUI, you can first try to start the .exe directly in the command-line.*

*If the problem still persists, you can follow the guide to run the [python-version](#python-version).*

*(e. g. the Python version support Open-GL Versions < 2.0 now)*


![RC_GUI WINDOWS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/QueensGambit/GithubRepositoryClassifier/master/gui_prototype/media/readme/rc_gui_windows.png "rc")

![RC_CLI WINDOWS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/QueensGambit/GithubRepositoryClassifier/master/gui_prototype/media/readme/rc_cli_windows.png)

The rc_cli will provide a way for you to use the classifier with the commandline, including a console-menu.
It also accepts a GitHub-Url as a console-argument if you wish to automate the classification process.
Besides, you can also transfer a path to a .txt file with repositories urls separated by a line break. The repositories will be classified and a result file will be created in the same directory.

### Python-Version

First clone this repository or download and extract it as a .zip-file.
```
git clone https://github.com/QueensGambit/GitHubRepositoryClassifier
```

#### Windows

*The Python Version has been tested with Python 3.5.1 on Windows 8.1 and Windows 10*

*[optional] Create a virtual environment in a directory of your choice and activate it.*
*[optional] Activate the virtual environment:*
```
virtualenv --no-site-packages env
env/Scripts/activate.bat
````

*[optional] Install the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) which provides most packages from the start:*

Install all remaining requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you have trouble installing some of these package (e.g. **kivy**) via pip, it's easiest to download them from this website:

[http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#kivy](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#kivy)

After downloading the .whl file install the precompiled packages by opening cmd.exe in the directory and then run:
```
pip install my-package.whl
````

*Alternatively you can build these packages yourself. For this you must have [Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools](http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools)
or [Visual Studio 2015 / Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) installed.*

*To build kivy on windows it's recommend to follow the official installation guide:*

*[https://kivy.org/docs/installation/installation-windows.html](https://kivy.org/docs/installation/installation-windows.html)*


#### Linux-Ubuntu
*[optional] Activate the virtual environment:*
```
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
pip3 install virtualenv
virtualenv --no-site-packages env
source my_project/bin/activate
```

In order to install packages on Linux it's likely that you need the Python dev-packages.
```
sudo apt-get install build-essential gfortran libatlas-base-dev python3-dev
```

You can now install the required packages:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

*If you have issues installing kivy with the pip command you can alternatively install it with the Ubuntu package management:*

*See [https://kivy.org/docs/installation/installation-linux.html](https://kivy.org/docs/installation/installation-linux.html) for more information.*
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:kivy-team/kivy
sudo apt-get install python3-kivy
# optionally you can download the official kivy-examples:
# sudo apt-get install python-kivy-examples
````

_if you use an Anaconda Environment [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38981491/installing-kivy-in-anaconda](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38981491/installing-kivy-in-anaconda) you can install it via:_
```
conda install --channel https://conda.anaconda.org/jiayi_anaconda kivy
```

The app uses the stopwords data-set from the nltk-package. Download it with the command:
```
python3
nltk.download()
# select 'stopwords' in the dialog 'All Packages'
```

In order to display plots interactively in the GUI a backend for kivy is needed:
```
garden install matplotlib
```


You should now be able to start the GUI via **./rc_gui.sh** and the CLI via **./rc_cli.sh**.


*The app has been tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS with Python 3.4.1.*

![RC_CLI UBUNTU](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/QueensGambit/GithubRepositoryClassifier/master/gui_prototype/media/readme/rc_cli_ubuntu.png)


*If you still encounter problems by installing the program you're advised to create an issue at the [issue-page](https://github.com/QueensGambit/GitHubRepositoryClassifier/issues).*
