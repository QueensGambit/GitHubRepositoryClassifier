It includes modules for statistics, optimization,\nintegration, linear algebra, Fourier transforms, signal and image processing,\nODE solvers, and more.  It is also the name of a very popular conference on\nscientific programming with Python.\n\nThe SciPy library depends on NumPy, which provides convenient and fast\nN-dimensional array manipulation. The SciPy library is built to work with\nNumPy arrays, and provides many user-friendly and efficient numerical routines\nsuch as routines for numerical integration and optimization. Together, they\nrun on all popular operating systems, are quick to install, and are free of\ncharge. NumPy and SciPy are easy to use, but powerful enough to be depended\nupon by some of the world\'s leading scientists and engineers. If you need to\nmanipulate numbers on a computer and display or publish the results, give\nSciPy a try!\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nFor installation instructions, see ``INSTALL.rst.txt``.\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nScipy documentation is available on the web:\n\n    https://docs.scipy.org\n\nHow to generate the HTML documentation, see ``doc/README.txt``.\n\n\nWeb sites\n---------\n\nThe user\'s site is:\n\n    https://www.scipy.org/\n\n\nMailing Lists\n-------------\n\nPlease see the developer\'s list here:\n\n    http://projects.scipy.org/mailman/listinfo/scipy-dev\n\n\nLatest source code\n------------------\n\nThe latest development version of Scipy\'s sources are always available at:\n\n    https://github.com/scipy/scipy\n\nThey can be downloaded as a zip file or using the Git client.\n\n\nBug reports\n-----------\n\nTo search for bugs or report them, please use the Scipy Bug Tracker at:\n\n    https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues\n\n\nDeveloper information\n---------------------\n\nIf you would like to take part in SciPy development, take a look\nat the file ``CONTRIBUTING``.\n\n\nLicense information\n-------------------\n\nSee the file ``LICENSE.txt`` for information on the history of this\nsoftware, terms & conditions for usage, and a DISCLAIMER OF ALL\nWARRANTIES.\n'
