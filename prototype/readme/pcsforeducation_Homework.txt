b"This is the accumulated homework of Josh Gachnang.\nI am a junior at University of Wisconsin Madison. This repository was created\nto give me a way to keep all my code in version control across multiple \nmachines, not so you can cheat on homework. However, I do realize that a lot \nof this code may be helpful for other, non-UW-Madison activities, so I'm \nproviding it to the world (though it is not always the best code, so be \nwarned!) I also believe in openness as a way of life, so this is provided\nfree of charge to everyone.  All the code is provided under the New BSD \nLicense, except code obtained from instructors (ask them for a license).\n\n"
