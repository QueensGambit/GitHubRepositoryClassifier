b'#Open-Source-Catalog\n\n\n##About\n\nThis GitHub repository is maintained by the [NASA OCIO Open Innovation Team](http://open.nasa.gov/about/) and contains a catalog of publicly available NASA open source projects that are published on [code.nasa.gov](http://code.nasa.gov). The catalog is persisted as a JSON file ```catalog.json``` and contains an array of projects.  As Code Sharing at NASA is a community effort, we encourage NASA developers to add a meta-record in to this catalog to publish their open source projects on [code.nasa.gov](http://code.nasa.gov/).\n\n##Requirements\n* Open Source software project approved for open source release by your [NASA Field Center SRA](http://code.nasa.gov/#/guide)\n* Code Project hosted in a code repository (preferably GitHub.com) and visible to Internet Users\n* Meta record of your software project; instantiate ```required_fields_project_template.json```\n\n## Add your project\n\n* Create a project meta-record using the template from file required_fields_project_template.json:\n  * Note that Category labels longer than 24 characters will be truncated.\n```\n{\n\t"NASA Center": "Ames Research Center",\n    "Contributors": [\n      "jasonduley"\n    ],\n    "Software": "My Software Project",\n    "External Link": "https://github.com/nasa/my-software-project/wiki",\n    "Public Code Repo": "https://github.com/nasa/my-software-project",\n    "Description": "This is a description of the software project.",\n    "License": [\n      "NASA Open Source"\n    ],\n    "Categories": [\n      "Framework",\n      "Toolkit",\n      "Web"\n    ],\n    "Update_Date": "2014-09-23"\n}\n```\n\n* Add your instantiated meta-record to the array in the catalog.json file via a pull request\n* Once the merge is complete, your project will be published on [code.nasa.gov](http://code.nasa.gov/)\n\n##Thanks\nSpecial thanks goes out to [Chris Mattmann (NASA JPL)](https://github.com/chrismattmann), Sean Kelly (NASA JPL) and [Eric Whyne (DARPA)](https://github.com/ericwhyne) for their inspiration for this effort.\n'
