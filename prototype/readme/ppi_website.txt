b"README\n======\n\nCode behind the `www.ppi.io` website using PPI framework.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nDrop this skeleton app into your document root somewhere. You need to run the composer library to obtain the vendor dependencies that PPI requires.\n\n``` bash\ncurl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php\nphp composer.phar install\n```\n\nIdeally you'll want to set up a vhost on your httpd web server to point your domain to the /public/ folder of your PPI skeleton app, but for now you're still able to browse to http://localhost/skeletonapp/public/\n"
