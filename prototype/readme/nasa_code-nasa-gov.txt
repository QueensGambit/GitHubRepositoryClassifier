b'# CODE.NASA.GOV\n\nCatalog of Open Source Software from NASA. Built using [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org).\n\n## Setup\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nInstall bower and [polymer-cli](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-cli):\n\n    npm install -g bower polymer-cli\n\n### Install dependencies\n\n    bower i\n\n### Start the development server\n\nThis command serves the app at `http://localhost:8080` and provides basic URL\nrouting for the app:\n\n    polymer serve --open\n\n\n### Build\n\nThis command performs HTML, CSS, and JS minification on the application\ndependencies, and generates a service-worker.js file with code to pre-cache the\ndependencies based on the entrypoint and fragments specified in `polymer.json`.\nThe minified files are output to the `build/unbundled` folder, and are suitable\nfor serving from a HTTP/2+Push compatible server.\n\nIn addition the command also creates a fallback `build/bundled` folder,\ngenerated using fragment bundling, suitable for serving from non\nH2/push-compatible servers or to clients that do not support H2/Push.\n\n    polymer build\n\n### Preview the build\n\nThis command serves the minified version of the app at `http://localhost:8080`\nin an unbundled state, as it would be served by a push-compatible server:\n\n    polymer serve build/unbundled\n\nThis command serves the minified version of the app at `http://localhost:8080`\ngenerated using fragment bundling:\n\n    polymer serve build/bundled\n    \n### Deploying\n\nWhen deploying to a static web server (with no HTTP/2+Push), be sure to copy\nthe files from `build/bundled` (**NOT** the project directory) which\ncontains a functional service worker and minified files.\n\n### Adding a new view\n\nYou can extend the app by adding more views that will be demand-loaded\ne.g. based on the route, or to progressively render non-critical sections\nof the application.  Each new demand-loaded fragment should be added to the\nlist of `fragments` in the included `polymer.json` file.  This will ensure\nthose components and their dependencies are added to the list of pre-cached\ncomponents (and will have bundles created in the fallback `bundled` build).\n'
