b'# OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS)\n\nThe OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) is a set of generic attack detection rules for use with ModSecurity or compatible web application firewalls. The CRS aims to protect web applications from a wide range of attacks, including the OWASP Top Ten, with a minimum of false alerts.\n\n## CRS Resources\n\nPlease see the [OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set page](https://modsecurity.org/crs/) to get introduced to the CRS and view resources on installation, configuration, and working with the CRS.\n\n## Contributing to the CRS\n\nWe strive to make the OWASP ModSecurity CRS accessible to a wide audience of beginner and experienced users. We are interested in hearing any bug reports, false positive alert reports, evasions, usability issues, and suggestions for new detections.\n\n[Create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/owasp-modsecurity-crs/issues) to report a false positive or false negative (evasion). Please include your installed version and the relevant portions of your ModSecurity audit log.\n\n[Sign up for the mailing list](https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-modsecurity-core-rule-set) to ask general usage questions and participate in discussions on the CRS.\n\n[Join the #modsecurity channel on Freenode IRC](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23modsecurity) to chat about the CRS.\n\n## License\n\nCopyright 2006-2016 Trustwave and contributors.\n\nThe OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set is distributed under Apache Software License (ASL) version 2.
