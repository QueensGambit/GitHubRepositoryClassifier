Each tag produces an index of tagged pages\n- bigimg: an array of images which will rotate behind the title of the post\n- comments: allow disqus comments on the post\n\n### Sample FrontMatter\n\n```yaml\ntitle: Deploying a Resource Manager Template\nsubtitle: Building infrastructure with Ruby on Azure\ntags:\n  - Ruby\n  - IaaS\nbigimg:\n  - /images/hero-partners.png\n  - https://udemy-images.udemy.com/course/750x422/8082_e627_11.jpg\n  - https://images7.alphacoders.com/679/thumb-1920-679140.png\ncomments: true\n```\n\n### Sample Draft\n\nYou can find a sample draft in the [_drafts](./_drafts) folder.\n\n### Ready to Post?\n\nOpen a pull request with your changes and upon merge, your post will be deployed to https://azure.github.io.\n\n## Contributing\n\n1.
