b"Logic Homework\n==============\n\nI took [Charlie Barnes' Logic, Reasoning, and\nProofs](https://sites.google.com/site/barneslogicf13/home). I completed the\ncourse the Fall semester of 2012, and it was great! It is based on his textbook\nwhich can be found\n[here](https://sites.google.com/site/barneslogicf13/materials) along with other\ncourse material.\n\nMachine Learning\n================\n\nI am working on the homework from Andrew Ng's [machine learning course on\nCoursera](https://class.coursera.org/ml-005). I am using IPython Notebooks in\ncombination with the NumPy rather than Octave, which the instructor uses. I\ninvite the reader to compare both programming languages and decide for\nhimself/herself which one is more agreeable.\n\nDigital Signal Processing\n=========================\n\nI am reworking some homework from [Digital Signal Processing]\n(https://class.coursera.org/dsp-004) on Coursera. They use IPython Notebooks,\nas well as I.\n"
