See\nthe `AUTHORS.rst <AUTHORS.rst>`_ file for a complete list of contributors.\n\nIt is currently maintained by a team of volunteers.\n\nWebsite: http://scikit-learn.org\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nDependencies\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nscikit-learn requires:\n\n- Python (>= 2.7 or >= 3.3)\n- NumPy (>= 1.6.1)\n- SciPy (>= 0.9)\n\nscikit-learn also uses CBLAS, the C interface to the Basic Linear Algebra\nSubprograms library. scikit-learn comes with a reference implementation, but\nthe system CBLAS will be detected by the build system and used if present.\nCBLAS exists in many implementations; see `Linear algebra libraries\n<http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/computational_performance.html#linear-algebra-libraries>`_\nfor known issues.\n\nUser installation\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIf you already have a working installation of numpy and scipy,\nthe easiest way to install scikit-learn is using ``pip`` ::\n\n    pip install -U scikit-learn\n\nor ``conda``::\n\n    conda install scikit-learn\n\nThe documentation includes more detailed `installation instructions <http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html>`_.\n\n\nDevelopment\n-----------\n\nWe welcome new contributors of all experience levels. The scikit-learn\ncommunity goals are to be helpful, welcoming, and effective. The\n`Development Guide <http://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/index.html>`_\nhas detailed information about contributing code, documentation, tests, and\nmore. We\'ve included some basic information in this README.\n\nImportant links\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Official source code repo: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn\n- Download releases: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/scikit-learn\n- Issue tracker: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues\n\nSource code\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nYou can check the latest sources with the command::\n\n    git clone https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn.git\n\nSetting up a development environment\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nQuick tutorial on how to go about setting up your environment to\ncontribute to scikit-learn: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n\nTesting\n~~~~~~~\n\nAfter installation, you can launch the test suite from outside the\nsource directory (you will need to have the ``nose`` package installed)::\n\n    nosetests -v sklearn\n\nUnder Windows, it is recommended to use the following command (adjust the path\nto the ``python.exe`` program) as using the ``nosetests.exe`` program can badly\ninteract with tests that use ``multiprocessing``::\n\n    C:\\Python34\\python.exe -c "import nose; nose.main()" -v sklearn\n\nSee the web page http://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/advanced_installation.html#testing\nfor more information.\n\n    Random number generation can be controlled during testing by setting\n    the ``SKLEARN_SEED`` environment variable.\n\nSubmitting a Pull Request\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nBefore opening a Pull Request, have a look at the\nfull Contributing page to make sure your code complies\nwith our guidelines: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/index.html\n\n\nProject History\n---------------\n\nThe project was started in 2007 by David Cournapeau as a Google Summer\nof Code project, and since then many volunteers have contributed.
