b'# University Domains and Names Data List & API\n\nDo you need a list of universities and their domain names? You found it! \n\nThis package includes a JSON file that contains domains, names and countries of most of the universities of the world.\n - You can create a validation script that checks the email domain. \n - You can automatically generate a user\'s country and university by looking at their emails.\n\n\nYou can use this data source in three ways:\n - Use the JSON file as your data source and do whatever you like with your favourite programming language.\n - Use free hosted-API.\n - Use the tiny Python app to serve a fast API that you can query data.\n\n\n### 1 - Using the Data Source\n\nThe whole data source is located in the `world_universities_and_domains.json` file. It is just a list of dictionaries in the following format:\n\n\t[\n\t\t...\n\t\t{\n\t\t    "alpha_two_code": "TR",\n\t\t    "country": "Turkey",\n\t\t    "domain": "sabanciuniv.edu.tr",\n\t\t    "name": "Sabanci University",\n\t\t    "web_page": "http://www.sabanciuniv.edu.tr/"\n\t\t},\n\t\t...\n\t]\n\n\nNOTE: Some universities use a format like `[user]@[department].[domain]`, but this list only contains the `[domain]` portion. \nFor example, an email address might be `[student]@cs.usc.edu`, and this list will contain \'usc.edu\', the domain for the \nUniversity of Southern California. Take this into consideration if using this list for email address validation.\n\n### 2 - Using Hosted API\n\nThis is the easiest method if you\'re making a small project or just want to discover the data without any hassle.\nIt is sponsored by [Hipo](http://www.hipolabs.com) and free. If you have a big project, please host it on your own server.\n\nSome example searches:\n\n - http://universities.hipolabs.com\n - http://universities.hipolabs.com/search?name=middle\n - http://universities.hipolabs.com/search?name=middle&country=turkey\n\nThe hosted API uses [university-domains-list-api](https://github.com/Hipo/university-domains-list-api) package.\n\n\n### 3 - Using the built-in API on your server\n\nYou can access the python API via [university-domains-list-api](https://github.com/Hipo/university-domains-list-api)\n\n# Contribution\nPlease contribute to this list! We need your support to keep this list up-to-date.\nDo not hesitate to fix any wrong data. It is extremely easy. Just open a PR, or create an issue. \n\n# Contributors\n\n - Yi\xc4\x9fit G\xc3\xbcler\n - Tuna Varg\xc4\xb1\n - Patrick Michelberger\n - Barricadenick\n - Rasim Demirbay\n - Ryan White\n - Bilal Arslan\n - anwilli5\n - Thomas Bauer\n - Emin Mastizada\n - Jai\n - Jimi Ford\n - Lars Schwegmann\n - Sedat Karanc\xc4\xb1\n - Charles Bedrosian\n - Harrison Lo\n - mattdfloyd\n - Ender Ahmet Yurt\n\n### Created and maintained by [Hipo](http://www.hipolabs.com)\n'
