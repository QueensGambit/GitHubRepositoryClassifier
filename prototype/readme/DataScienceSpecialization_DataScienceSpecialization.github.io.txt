b"# DSS Community Site\n\nSince the beginning of the Data Science Specialization we've noticed the unbelievable passion students have about our courses and the generosity they show toward each other on the course forums. A couple students have created quality content around the subjects we discuss, and many of these materials are so good we feel that they should be shared with all of our students. This site is meant to serve as a central directory for community created content.\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you've created a web page, video, slideshow, or any other kind of media you think should be shared through this directory you should:\n\n1. Fork this repository.\n2. Add a link to your content on the appropriate course page.\n3. Commit your changes. \n4. Submit a pull request.\n\nWe've created a [sample pull request](https://github.com/DataScienceSpecialization/DataScienceSpecialization.github.io/pull/1) to show you what we would like to see in a pull request. If we think your creation is well made, informative, and adds something new to this repository of content then we'll merge your request and add you to our list of contributors. If you happen to notice any inaccuracies or idiosyncrasies on this site or in this site's content, please let us know by opening an issue.\n\n**If you are not the author of the content you are submitting** you are welcome to add your link to the [Curated Knowledge](http://datasciencespecialization.github.io/curated/) page. We've created this page specifically so that you can share data science resources that you've found useful.\n\n**Otherwise if you *are* the author of the content you're submitting** you should ask yourself the following questions:\n\n1. Does my contribution teach?\n2. Does the content of my contribution clearly address topics in the Data Science Specialization?\n3. Could my contribution be seamlessly integrated into the canonical course materials?\n\nIf you're on the fence about any of these, err on the side of sending a pull request! \n"
