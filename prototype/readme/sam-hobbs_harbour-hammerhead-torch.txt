b'# Hammerhead Torch\nA simple torch app, originally written for the LG Nexus 5 (codename "hammerhead") port of Sailfish OS.\n\nHammerhead Torch now automatically detects the following hardware:\n* Jolla A\n* LG Nexus 5 ("Hammerhead")\n* Fairphone 2\n* Motorola Photon Q\n* Jolla C / Intex Aqua Fish\n\nSupport can be added for any device with an LED that can be controlled using a simple switch file (e.g. file contents >0 for on, 0 for off) by mapping the hardware device name found in /etc/hw-release to the control file path using controlfile.conf.\n\nSimilarly, devices that have control files with variable brightness can set the max brightness in brightness.conf.\n\nFeel free to submit a pull request or contact me to add auto-detection support for your device.\n'
