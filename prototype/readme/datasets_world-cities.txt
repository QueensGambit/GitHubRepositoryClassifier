b"List of major cities in the world\n\n## Data\n\nThe data is extracted from [geonames][geonames], a very exhaustive list of worldwide toponyms.\n\nThis [datapackage][datapackage] only list cities above 15,000 inhabitants. Each city is associated with its \ncountry and subcountry to reduce the number of ambiguities. Subcountry can be the name of a state (eg in \nUnited Kingdom or the United States of America) or the major administrative section (eg ''region'' in France''). \nSee ``admin1`` field on [geonames website][geonames] for further info about subcountry.\n\nNotice that :\n* some cities like *Vatican city* or *Singapore* are a whole state so they don't belong to any subcountry. Therefore subcountry is ``N/A``.\n* There is no guaranty that a city has a unique name in a country and subcountry (At the time of writing, there are about 60 ambiguities). But for each city, \nthe source data primary key ``geonameid`` is provided.\n\n[geonames]: http://www.geonames.org/\n[datapackage]: http://dataprotocols.org/data-packages/\n\n\n## Preparation\n\nYou can run the script yourself to update the data and publish them to github : see [scripts README](scripts/README.md)\n\n## License\n\nAll data is licensed under the [Creative Common Attribution License][CC] as is the original data from [geonames][geonames].
