b"# DevOps Bootcamp Website & Curriculum\n\nThe site is hosted at [devopsbootcamp.osuosl.org][DOBC.O.O]. \n\nThis repository has a post-commit hook set up to update the main site every\ntime the master branch is changed. If the site doesn't update within a couple\nof minutes, the build may have failed. Check that `make html` doesn't throw\nany errors in your copy of the repo, and ask someone with admin access on\nreadthedocs to investigate what it reports is broken.\n\n## Viewing Slides: \n\nSlides are available on [slides.osuosl.org][SLIDES.O.O/DOBC], and rebuild\nautomatically whenever new content is pushed to the master branch of this\nrepo.\n\nThe script in scripts/build.sh automatically removes the slides that were built\nof non-slides content, based on the assumption that the filenames of all actual \nslides start with the week number.   \n\nYou can also build the slides locally if you've been editing them and want to\nsee how they'll look before you push, or if you don't have push access to the\nproject: \n\n```\n$ sudo pip install virtualenv\n$ git clone https://github.com/DevOpsBootcamp/website.git\n$ cd website\n$ virtualenv venv\n$ source venv/bin/activate # enter the virtual environment\n$ pip install -r requirements.txt\n\n# output lives in build/ and the stuff you want to edit is in source/\n# images and things go in source/static/\n\n$ make slides # slides will go to build/slides\n$ make html # to preview roughly how it'll look on readthedocs\n\n$ deactivate # leave the virtual environment\n```\n\n## About\n\nCheck out our list of [contributors][CONTRIBUTORS] to see who's worked on the\nDOBC curriculum.\n\n[DOBC.O.O]: http://devopsbootcamp.osuosl.org/\n[CONTRIBUTORS]: https://github.com/DevOpsBootcamp/website/graphs/contributors\n[SLIDES.O.O/DOBC]: http://slides.osuosl.org/devopsbootcamp/\nhttps://github.com/DevOpsBootcamp/website/graphs/contributors\n"
