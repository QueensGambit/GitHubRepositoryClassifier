b"# Prosemirror.net\n\nThese are the sources for http://prosemirror.net\n\nThis currently contains a [front-page](http://prosemirror.net), the\n[demos](http://prosemirror.net/#demos) (including server-side code to\nsupport the\n[collaborative demo](http://prosemirror.net/demo/collab.html)), the\n[guides](http://prosemirror.net/docs.html), and the scripts to build\nthe [reference docs](http://prosemirror.net/ref.html).\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall [Node.js](http://nodejs.org).\n\nInstall the module's dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install\n```\n\nBuild the documentation and all the demos' JavaScript source\n\n```bash\nmake\n```\n\nThat will populate the `public/` directory with an instance of the\nwebsite. You could point a webserver at it to try it out.\n\nTo work on the demos, or to experiment with the collaborative demo, it\nis a good idea to use the dev server:\n\n```\nnpm run devserver -- --port 8888\n```\n\nThat will get you a server at [localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888/)\nthat serves the files in `public/`, along with the collaborative\nediting backend, and updates the demo pages to use\n[moduleserve](https://github.com/marijnh/moduleserve) so that you can\nrun the demos directly from the source files, rather than using the\nbundled code. You can now edit them and see the changes with a single\nrefresh. (Though the server-side collaborative code still needs a\nserver refresh to update.)\n\nNote that this is not secure (it provides filesystem access of HTTP)\nand not fast (the browser will fetch each module individually), and\nshould only be used for development, on your local machine, bound to\n`localhost`.\n"
