b'QNeuralNetwork\n   by Marcus Soll\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQNeuralNetwork (qnn) is a simple to use, customisable and efficient library for\nneural network. QNeuralNetwork is written in C++/Qt.\n\nQNeuralNetwork uses an easy internal model. A network is solely defined through\nits type, its configuration and its gene. A gene contains a number of segments,\neach segment is a list of numbers.\n\nA network can be trained for a task using a genetic algorithm. The task is\ncontained in a simulation.\n\nQNeuralNetwork is licensed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\nLicense Version 3 or (at your option) any later version.'
