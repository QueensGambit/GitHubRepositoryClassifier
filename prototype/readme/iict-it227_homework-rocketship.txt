If you already know how to use github, you may skip this step.\n\n> Only the merged working directories will be given points, email or personal submission will not be accepted.\n\n> Please do not delete or modify your classmate\'s working directory. Thanks!\n\n### Instructions\n1. Work alone or with a partner.\n2. Fork this repository.\n3. Clone your forked repository into your hard drive.\n4.
