b'                   ------------------------------\n                   GNU Image Manipulation Program\n                       2.9 Development Branch\n                   ------------------------------\n\nThis is an unstable development release, an intermediate state on the\nway to the next stable release 2.10. GIMP 2.9 may or may not do what\nyou expect. Save your work early and often. If you want a stable\nversion, please use GIMP 2.8 instead.\n\nGIMP 2.9 replaces earlier GIMP 2.x versions. It is advised that you\nuninstall them before installing GIMP 2.9. If you want to keep your\nolder GIMP 2.x installation in parallel to GIMP 2.9, you have to\nchoose a separate prefix which is not in your default library search\npath. Otherwise your previous GIMP installation will start to use the\nnew libraries. You have been warned.\n\nIf you think you found a bug in this version, please make sure that it\nhasn\'t been reported earlier and that it is not just new stuff that is\nstill being worked on and obviously not quite finished yet.\n\nIf you want to hack on GIMP, please read the file HACKING. For\ndetailed installation instructions, see the file INSTALL.\n\n\n1. Web Resources\n================\n\nGIMP\'s home page is at:\n\n\thttp://www.gimp.org/\n\nPlease be sure to visit this site for information, documentation,\ntutorials, news, etc.  All things GIMP-ish are available from there.\n\nThe automated plug-in registry is located at:\n\n\thttp://registry.gimp.org/\n\nThere you can get the latest versions of plug-ins, using a convenient\nforms-based interface.\n\nThe latest version of GIMP can be found at:\n\n\thttp://www.gimp.org/downloads/\n\n\n2. Mailing Lists\n================\n\nWe have several mailing lists dedicated to GIMP user and development\ndiscussion.  There is more info at\n\n\thttp://www.gimp.org/mail_lists.html\n\nLinks to several archives of the mailing lists are included in that page.\n\nGimp-user-list is a mailing list dedicated to user problems, hints and\ntips, discussion of cool effects, etc.  Gimp-developer-list is oriented\nto GIMP core and plug-in developers.  Gimp-gui-list is for discussing\nabout GIMP interface to improve user experience. Most people will only\nwant to be subscribed to gimp-user-list. If you want to help develop\nGIMP, the gimp-developer mailing list is a good starting point; if you\nwant to help with GUI design, the gimp-gui list is where you want to\nsubscribe.\n\n\n3. IRC\n======\n\nAnd finally, for the real junkies, there is an IRC channel devoted to\nGIMP. On GIMPNet (a private free software oriented network) there is\n#gimp.  Many of the developers hang out there.  Some of the GIMPNet\nservers are:\n\n\tirc.gimp.org:6667\n\tirc.us.gimp.org:6667\n\tirc.eu.gimp.org:6667\n\n\n4. Customizing\n==============\n\nThe look of GIMP\'s interface can be customized like any other GTK app\nby editing the ~/.gtkrc-2.0 file or by using "themes" (ready-made\ncustomizations).  For downloadable themes and further details, see\nhttp://art.gnome.org/themes/gtk2 . Additionally, GIMP reads the file\n~/.config/GIMP/2.9/gtkrc so you can have settings that only apply to GIMP.\n\nIncluded is a set of keybindings similar to those in Adobe Photoshop.\nYou can find them in the ps-menurc file.  To use them, copy this file\nto ~/.config/GIMP/2.9/menurc. You can also manually change the keybindings to\nany of your choice by editing ~/.config/GIMP/2.9/menurc.\n\n\nHave fun,\n\n  Spencer Kimball\n  Peter Mattis\n  Federico Mena\n  Manish Singh\n  Sven Neumann\n  Michael Natterer\n  Dave Neary\n  Martin Nordholts\n'
