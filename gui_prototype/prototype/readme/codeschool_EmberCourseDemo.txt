b"# README\n\nThis is the companion code for the Code Schools Ember course. This showcases the code used in the slides.\n\n## Complete Example\n\nThe finished application can be found at `demo/index.html`. Open that up in your browser and you're good to go!\n\nIf you want to see what the application looked like at a specific state during the course, you can go the more elaborate route and set up the Rails application which allows for serving the ember app at each point we show it during the slides.\n\n## Setup\n\nThis is a Ruby on Rails application, so in order to run it you'll need to have Ruby 1.9.3. Here's the setup you'll need to do to in order to see the examples.\n\nFirst off, you'll need to have Ruby installed. We recommend using either [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) or [RVM](https://rvm.io/), but your system Ruby will suffice as well. Code School has a [Code TV](https://www.codeschool.com/code_tv/rvm) on using RVM as well.\n\nWith Ruby installed, make sure to install the bundler gem.\n\n```\n$ gem install bundler\n```\n\nNext, download or clone this repository, change directory into it, and `bundle`.\n\n```\n$ git clone https://github.com/codeschool/EmberCourseDemo.git\n$ cd EmberCourseDemo\nEmberCourseDemo $ bundle install\n```\n\nNext, setup the database -- which contains information on the code samples used in the course.\n\n```\nEmberCourseDemo $ bundle exec rake db:setup\n```\n\n## Running\n\nAfter that, you should be all set to run the application:\n\n```\nEmberCourseDemo $ bundle exec rails s\n```\n\nThis will start the application on port 3000. Open up [http://localhost:3000/examples](http://localhost:3000/examples) in a browser and head to any code sample.\n"
