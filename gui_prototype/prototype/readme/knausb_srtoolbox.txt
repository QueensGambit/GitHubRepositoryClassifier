b'Short read toolbox.\n\nA collection of scripts for working with genomic data.\n\n**align2fastas.pl** - Reads in a fasta file with multiple sequences, creates a new directory and populates that directory with fasta files that each have only one sequence in them.  The number of resulting files is equal to the number of sequences in the original fasta file.\n\n**fasta2nuccomp.pl**  - Reads in a fasta file, such as a genome, calculates length, A/T content, G/C content, N content, IUPAC polymorphic content (non A,C,G,T or N) as well as other nucleotides (nucleotides not included in the previous categories).  This information is written to a text file (comma delimited, with header) which is then read into R for plotting.  If you do not have R installed the plotting step will fail.  But you can read the text file into your favarite plotting package and use it as you wish.\n\n*EOF*\n'
