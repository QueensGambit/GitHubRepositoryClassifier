Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.\n* **Component-Based:** Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.\n* **Learn Once, Write Anywhere:** We don\'t make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).\n\n[Learn how to use React in your own project](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html).\n\n## Examples\n\nWe have several examples [on the website](https://facebook.github.io/react/). Here is the first one to get you started:\n\n```jsx\nclass HelloMessage extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return <div>Hello {this.props.name}</div>;\n  }\n}\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <HelloMessage name="John" />,\n  document.getElementById(\'container\')\n);\n```\n\nThis example will render "Hello John" into a container on the page.\n\nYou\'ll notice that we used an HTML-like syntax; [we call it JSX](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html). JSX is not required to use React, but it makes code more readable, and writing it feels like writing HTML. A simple transform is included with React that allows converting JSX into native JavaScript for browsers to digest.\n\n## Installation\n\nThe fastest way to get started is to serve JavaScript from a CDN. We\'re using [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/) below but React is also available on [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/react) and [jsdelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/projects/react):\n\n```html\n<!-- The core React library -->\n<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@15.4.0/dist/react.js"></script>\n<!-- The ReactDOM Library -->\n<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@15.4.0/dist/react-dom.js"></script>\n```\n\nWe\'ve also built a [starter kit](https://facebook.github.io/react/downloads/react-15.4.0.zip) which might be useful if this is your first time using React. It includes a webpage with an example of using React with live code.\n\nIf you\'d like to use [bower](http://bower.io), it\'s as easy as:\n\n```sh\nbower install --save react\n```\n\nAnd it\'s just as easy with [npm](http://npmjs.com):\n\n```sh\nnpm i --save react\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nThe main purpose of this repository is to continue to evolve React core, making it faster and easier to use. Development of React happens in the open on GitHub, and we are grateful to the community for contributing bugfixes and improvements. Read below to learn how you can take part in improving React.\n\n### [Code of Conduct](https://code.facebook.com/codeofconduct)\n\nFacebook has adopted a Code of Conduct that we expect project participants to adhere to.
