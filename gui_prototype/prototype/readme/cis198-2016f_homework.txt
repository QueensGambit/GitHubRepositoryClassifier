b"# CIS 198 Homework - Fall 2016\n\nThis repo stores the homework assignments for CIS 198.\n\nWe are using Classroom for GitHub. That means each student can create a private\nGitHub repository to do their work in. Except for hw0 (which has almost no\nsubmitable content), these links are public for anyone to use! If you're a Penn\nstudent enrolled in the class, this is also how you submit assignments: just\npush to your repository by the due date.\n\nPull requests or issues are welcome and highly appreciated!\n"
