b'#X-Plane Connect\nThe X-Plane Connect (XPC) Toolbox is an open source research tool used to\ninteract with the commercial flight simulator software X-Plane. XPC allows users\nto control aircraft and receive state information from aircraft simulated in\nX-Plane using functions written in C, C++, Java, MATLAB, or Python in real time over the\nnetwork. This research tool has been used to visualize flight paths, test control\nalgorithms, simulate an active airspace, or generate out-the-window visuals for\nin-house flight simulation software. Possible applications include active control\nof an XPlane simulation, flight visualization, recording states during a flight,\nor interacting with a mission over UDP.\n\n###Migrating to 1.0\nFor existing users, several important breaking changes have been made in version\n1.0. For detailed information, see the 1.0 release changelog. For client-specific\nguidlines on migrating to 1.0, refer to the follwing guides:\n\n####[C](https://github.com/nasa/XPlaneConnect/wiki/Migrating-to-1.0-C)\n\n####[MATLAB](https://github.com/nasa/XPlaneConnect/wiki/Migrating-to-1.0-MATLAB)\n\n####[Java](https://github.com/nasa/XPlaneConnect/wiki/Migrating-to-1.0-Java)\n\n###Architecture\nXPC includes an X-Plane plugin (xpcPlugin) and clients written in several\nlanguages that interact with the plugin.\n\n####Quick Start\nTo get started using X-Plane Connect, do the following.\n\n1. Purchase and install X-Plane 9 or 10.\n2. Copy the X-Plane Plugin folder (xpcPlugin/XPlaneConnect) to the plugin\ndirectory ([X-Plane Directory]/Resources/plugins/)\n3. Write some code using one of the clients to manipulate X-Plane data.\n\nEach client is located in a top-level directory of the repository named for the\nclient\'s language. The client directories generally include a \'src\' folder\ncontaining the client source code, and an \'Examples\' folder containing sample\ncode demonstrating how to use the client.\n\n####Additional Information\nFor detailed information about XPC and how to use the XPC clients, refer to the\n[XPC Wiki](https://github.com/nasa/XPlaneConnect/wiki).\n\n####Capabilities\nThe XPC Toolbox allows the user to manipulate the internal state of X-Plane by\nreading and setting DataRefs, a complete list of which can be found on the\n[X-Plane SDK wiki](http://www.xsquawkbox.net/xpsdk/docs/DataRefs.html).\n\nIn addition, several convenience functions are provided, which allow the user to\nefficiently execute common commands. These functions include the ability to set\nthe position and control surfaces of both player and multiplayer aircraft. In\naddition, the pause function allows users to easily pause and un-pause X-Plane\'s\nphysics simulation engine.\n\n###Compatibility\nXPC has been tested with the following software versions:\n* Windows: Vista, 7, & 8\n* Mac OSX: 10.8-10.11\n* Linux: Tested on Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation release 6.6\n* X-Plane: 9 & 10\n\n###Contributing\nAll contributions are welcome! If you are having problems with the plugin, please\nopen an issue on GitHub or email [Chris Teubert](mailto:christopher.a.teubert@nasa.gov).\nIf you would like to contribute directly, please feel free to open a pull request\nagainst the "develop" branch. Pull requests will be evaluated and integrated into\nthe next official release.\n\n###Notices\nCopyright \xc2\xa92013-2015 United States Government as represented by the Administrator\nof the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
