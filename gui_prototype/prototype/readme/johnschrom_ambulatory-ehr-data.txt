b"# ambulatory-ehr-data\n300k patient records generated to be nationally representative using NAMCS\n\nThis repo contains 300k patients generated using the patient-data-generator, which is powered off the 2012 NAMCS survey.  Results are sampled and slightly randomized from the NAMCS survey, and reformatted to be in a format more consistent with EHR data.\n\nThis repo also contains a sql script to compile the data into a single sqlite database.  To run, just execute the bash script:\n\n    bash build-sqlite.sh\n\nOr run build-sqlite.sql within sqlite.\n\nThis data, while intended to be nationally representative and clinically accurate, is not guaranteed to be such.  So, it's better for learning or testing methods on than for doing current public health or clinical research.\n"
