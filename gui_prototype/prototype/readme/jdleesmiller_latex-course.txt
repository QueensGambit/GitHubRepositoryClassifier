b"latex-course\n============\n\nSlides for an introductory course on LaTeX. The slides and their LaTeX source\ncode are provided in [this github repository](https://github.com/jdleesmiller/latex-course) under a permissive MIT license.\n\nThe aim is to get students writing in LaTeX as quickly as possible. The material is presented as a set of examples, and broader concepts and techniques are explained as they arise. Each part includes exercises that can be completed on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com), the free online LaTeX editor, so you don't have to worry about getting LaTeX and related tools installed on everyone's computers.\n\nThese slides were originally used to deliver two two-hour workshops, but there is probably enough material for three workshops, so there are three parts:\n\n1. [The Basics](http://jdleesmiller.github.io/latex-course/en/part1.pdf): ideas, syntax, equations, environments, packages\n\n1. [Structed Documents &\nMore](http://jdleesmiller.github.io/latex-course/en/part2.pdf): titles, sections, cross-references, figures, tables, bibliographies.\n\n1. [Not Just Papers: Presentations & More](http://jdleesmiller.github.io/latex-course/en/part3.pdf): recap exercise, presentations with beamer, drawings with\ntikz.\n\nFeel free to use however you like --- contributions welcome!\n\nDevelopment\n-----------\n\nYou may need to install some extra LaTeX packages and system packages in order\nto build the slides yourself.\n\n1. The [minted package](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/minted) provides syntax\nhighlighting. It is installed by default in recent versions of TeX Live.\n\n1. The minted package calls out to the\n[pygments syntax highlighter](http://pygments.org/), which is written in python.\nThe relevant package is python-pygments in Debian / Ubuntu\n(`sudo apt-get install python-pygments`).\n\n1. There is a simple `Makefile` that manages the build. To use it, you'll\nprobably need to be on Linux, and you will need `make`.\n\nThe slides include links to exercises that open in Overleaf. The exercise\nsource files are hosted on github. If you want to use exercise files in another\nlocation, you can [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) this\ngithub repository and then change the `\\fileuri` macro in `preamble.tex`:\n```\n\\newcommand{\\fileuri}{https://raw.github.com/jdleesmiller/latex-course/master/en}\n```\nso that instead of pointing to `jdleesmiller/latex-course`, it points to\n`your-github-user-name/latex-course`. Then, once you've pushed your changed\nexercise files to github, the slides will load them up in Overleaf.\n\nThe `deploy-to-gh-pages.sh` script builds the slides using the Makefile and\ncopies the slides over to the `gh-pages` branch, which is available at\n`https://jdlm.info/latex-course` thanks to\n[github pages](http://pages.github.com/).\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nThe slides and source are released under the MIT license.
