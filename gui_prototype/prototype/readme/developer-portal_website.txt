b'# Website for Fedora Developer Portal\n**[Project Page](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Websites/Developer)** |\n**[Content Repository](https://github.com/developer-portal/content)** |\n[Website Repository](https://github.com/developer-portal/website)\n<hr>\n\nThis repository contains [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) templates, CSS styles and images for the [Fedora Developer Portal](https://developer.fedoraproject.org/).\n\nPlease submit your **ideas**, **bug reports** or **requests** regarding:\n- content of the portal in our [content repository issue tracker](https://github.com/developer-portal/content/issues).\n- the project, our processes or the portal itself on our [website repository issue tracker](https://github.com/developer-portal/website/issues).\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe whole site is generated with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) as a static site with some dynamic parts. Site search functionality is implemented in JavaScript and the index is pre-generated during the Jekyll build.\n\nThere is an `rss.py` script that replaces the blog posts section on the index page in the generated `_site/` from the Fedora Planet.\n\n## Development\n\nWe use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to generate the site, `setup.sh` script to install development dependencies (on Fedora) and we also provide [Vagrantfile](/Vagrantfile) and [Dockerfile](/Dockerfile)\nto spin up the whole development environment. [content](https://github.com/developer-portal/content) repository is a git submodule.\n\nSee our [development guide](/DEVELOPMENT.md) on how to run the site locally for development.\n\nTo build the site run `jekyll build` or `jekyll serve`. You need to install [dependencies](/setup.sh) first.\n\n## Tests\n\nWe have some basic Capybara/Webkit test specifications that can help you to notice if something broke. They will also check all internal links between pages so you should also run them to test changes in `content` repository.\n\nTo execute the test suite run `rspec spec`. You need to install [dependencies](/setup.sh) first and the site has to be already generated and available in `_site/` folder.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome! You can find us on `freenode` under `#developer-portal` if you have any further questions.\n'
