b'Perl\xc2\xa06 Design Documents\n=======================\n\nThis repository contains the Perl\xc2\xa06 design documents, also called "Synopses",\nin Pod (5 and 6) format. A [regularly updated HTML\nversion](http://design.perl6.org/) is available.\n\nHistorically, these documents have determined the direction of Perl\xc2\xa06. As\nimplementations matured, this role shifted (and still shifts) towards\ndocumenting the experience from the implementations.\n\nInstead the [test suite](https://github.com/perl6/roast/) is becoming the\nspecification, and the "specs" in the repository name of the design documents\ntends to mean "speculations" now.\n'
