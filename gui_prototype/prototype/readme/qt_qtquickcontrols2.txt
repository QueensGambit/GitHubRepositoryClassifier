b'Qt Quick Controls 2\n===================\n\nThe Qt Quick Controls 2 module delivers the next generation user interface\ncontrols based on Qt Quick. In comparison to the desktop-oriented Qt Quick\nControls 1, Qt Quick Controls 2 are an order of magnitude simpler, lighter and\nfaster, and are primarily targeted towards embedded and mobile platforms.\n\nQt Quick Controls 2 are based on a flexible template system that enables rapid\ndevelopment of entire custom styles and user experiences. Qt Quick Controls 2\ncomes with a selection of built-in styles:\n\n- Default style - a simple and minimal all-round style that offers the maximum performance\n- Material style - a style based on the Google Material Design Guidelines\n- Universal style - a style based on the Microsoft Universal Design Guidelines\n\nMore information can be found in the following blog posts:\n\n- http://blog.qt.io/blog/2015/03/31/qt-quick-controls-for-embedded/\n- http://blog.qt.io/blog/2015/11/23/qt-quick-controls-re-engineered-status-update/\n\n## Help\n\nIf you have problems or questions, don\'t hesitate to:\n\n- ask on the Qt Interest mailing list http://lists.qt-project.org/mailman/listinfo/interest\n- ask on the Qt Forum http://forum.qt.io/category/12/qt-quick\n- report issues to the Qt Bug Tracker https://bugreports.qt.io (component: *Qt Quick: Controls 2*)\n\n## Installation\n\nThe MINIMUM REQUIREMENT for building this project is to use the same branch\nof Qt 5.
