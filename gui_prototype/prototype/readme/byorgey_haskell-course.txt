b'Here you will find all the source material for my Haskell course,\nknown as "CIS 194" (its course number when I taught it at U Penn).\nNote that the course was taught several more times at Penn by other\ninstructors after I left; this repo does not contain any of their\nmaterials.\n\nThere are no solutions here.  My solutions are in another\ncastle^H^H^H^H^H^H private repo, to which I\'m happy to give access on\nrequest.\n\nAll the material here is licensed under a\n[Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\n'
