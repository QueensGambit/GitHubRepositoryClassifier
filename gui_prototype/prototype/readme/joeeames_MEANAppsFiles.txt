b'MEANAppsFiles\n=============\nThis course is out of date. \n\n## Express Changes\nThe latest version of express has deprecated the body parser middleware.\n\nThat means that when you see the following line of code:\n```\napp.use(bodyParser());\n```\nyou should instead use the following two lines of code:\n```\napp.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: true}));\napp.use(bodyParser.json());\n```\n\nThe latest version of express has also changed the session middleware a little bit and now requires that you explicitly specify a value for the resave parameter and the saveUninitialized parameter. So in the module on authentication when you see the following code:\n```\napp.use(session({secret: \'multi vision unicorns\'}))\n```\nyou should instead use the following code:\n```\napp.use(session({secret: \'multi vision unicorns\',resave:false,saveUninitialized:false}));\n```\n\n## Angular Changes\nIn addition to that, Angular 1.3 now requires a base tag when using html5Mode routing. In your layout.jade file (and maybe earlier in your index.jade), in the head you should place the following line of code:\n```\nbase(href="/")\n```\n\n## MongoDB Changes\nCurrent versions of MongoDB require a "query" when calling the remove function. So periodically in the course we will delete all the users from the db with the following command:\n```\ndb.users.remove()\n```\nBut instead, you need to pass an empty "query object" into the remove function like this:\n```\ndb.users.remove({})\n```\n\nNotes:\nTo run the node server, type "node web-server.js" or "nodemon web-server.js" from the directory that contains the web-server.js file\n\n## Crypto Changes\nIn more recent versions of node.js update() and digest() are legacy methods. The new approach is to use the streaming API methods write() end() and read();\n\n```\nfunction hashPwd(salt, pwd){\n  var hmac = crypto.createHmac(\'sha1\', salt);\n  hmac.setEncoding(\'hex\');\n  hmac.write(pwd);\n  hmac.end();\n  return hmac.read();\n}\n```\n'
