b'### Overview\n\nStockfish is a free UCI chess engine derived from Glaurung 2.1. It is\nnot a complete chess program and requires some UCI-compatible GUI\n(e.g. XBoard with PolyGlot, eboard, Arena, Sigma Chess, Shredder, Chess\nPartner or Fritz) in order to be used comfortably. Read the\ndocumentation for your GUI of choice for information about how to use\nStockfish with it.\n\nThis version of Stockfish supports up to 128 cores. The engine defaults\nto one search thread, so it is therefore recommended to inspect the value of\nthe *Threads* UCI parameter, and to make sure it equals the number of CPU\ncores on your computer.\n\n\n### Files\n\nThis distribution of Stockfish consists of the following files:\n\n  * Readme.md, the file you are currently reading.\n\n  * Copying.txt, a text file containing the GNU General Public License.\n\n  * src, a subdirectory containing the full source code, including a Makefile\n    that can be used to compile Stockfish on Unix-like systems.\n\n\n### Compiling it yourself\n\nOn Unix-like systems, it should be possible to compile Stockfish\ndirectly from the source code with the included Makefile.\n\nStockfish has support for 32 or 64-bit CPUs, the hardware POPCNT\ninstruction, big-endian machines such as Power PC, and other platforms.\n\nIn general it is recommended to run `make help` to see a list of make\ntargets with corresponding descriptions. When not using the Makefile to\ncompile (for instance with Microsoft MSVC) you need to manually\nset/unset some switches in the compiler command line; see file *types.h*\nfor a quick reference.\n\n\n### Terms of use\n\nStockfish is free, and distributed under the **GNU General Public License**\n(GPL). Essentially, this means that you are free to do almost exactly\nwhat you want with the program, including distributing it among your\nfriends, making it available for download from your web site, selling\nit (either by itself or as part of some bigger software package), or\nusing it as the starting point for a software project of your own.\n\nThe only real limitation is that whenever you distribute Stockfish in\nsome way, you must always include the full source code, or a pointer\nto where the source code can be found. If you make any changes to the\nsource code, these changes must also be made available under the GPL.\n\nFor full details, read the copy of the GPL found in the file named\n*Copying.txt*\n'
