After that you should be able to use the batch or exe file without any problems.*\n\n## Documentation\n\nPlease see the [wiki](https://github.com/QueensGambit/GitHubRepositoryClassifier/wiki/Documentation)\n\n# Info\n\n![HFU](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7681159/22186901/aaf6289c-e0fd-11e6-8b87-590aa5606871.png)\n'
