Abstract
--------
In many areas of our daily life, more and more intelligent systems are developed to support us. 
The goal of this paper is to provide a detailed overview over the implementation of a software system which was built for the automatic classification of GitHub-Repositories.
This task has been the subject of the InformatiCup 2017, hosted by the German Association for Computer Science.
The overview extensively covers the algorithms and procedures of this system as well as the underlying theoretical concepts of artificial intelligence and machine learning.
The achieved results are discussed and compared in great detail. Apart from a manual on how to use the developed program, this paper also lists approaches to alternative methods how a system like this could be implemented.
